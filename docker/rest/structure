Project structure:

# Sources

## Sources/App
 - The App folder contains all the source code grouped into organized subfolders.

### Sources/App/Models
 - The Models folder contains database and other models, following the MVC pattern.
 
### Sources/App/Controllers
 - The Controllers folder contains route controllers, following the MVC pattern.
 - Controllers help you organize related functionality into a single place. They can also be used to create RESTful resources.

# Resources

## Resources/Views:      
 - The Views folder in Resources is where Vapor will look when you render views. 
 - Views return HTML data from your application.

# Public
 - Any resources that your views need, such as images, styles, and scripts, should be placed in the Public folder at the root of your application.

# Config

 - For Vapor applications, configuration files are expected to be nested under a top level folder named Config.

 Example of a "servers.json" config file that's saying that our application should start a single server named 'http' serving port 8080 on host 0.0.0.0 : 
{
  "http": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 8080,
      "custom-key": "custom value"
  }
}

The "custom-key" can be accessed programatically by: "let customValue = app.config["server", "http", "custom-key"].string"
